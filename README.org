* BUNDY - authoritative DNS Server

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The BUNDY project is currently in *hibernation* status. It is not
dead, but it is also not alive either. There is currently no active
development, and no security bug fixes. We do not recommend using
BUNDY as a production DNS server. However, due to its Python code,
BUNDY is a great tool to prototype new DNS functions. If you have
interest on working on or with BUNDY, let us know. We can resume
development any time./
#+END_QUOTE

BUNDY provides an authoritative DNS server (with in-memory and SQLite3
backends), DNSSEC support, dynamic DNS, zone transfers.  Supplementary
components are included for statistics collection and reporting and
remote configuration and control are included, as is an experimental
recursive nameserver with support for forwarding. It is the
continuation of the BIND 10 project from the ISC hosted at
[[https://web.archive.org/web/20150215124722/http://bind10.isc.org:80/wiki][http://bind10.isc.org/]].

Since the June 2013 1.1.0 BIND 10 release, the new DNS highlights
include incoming zone transfer statistics, support for CAA and TLSA
resource records, and the zone loader now supports the zone file
$GENERATE directive.  Note that the bundy-xfrin "use_ixfr"
configuration item is deprecated and a new configuration
"zones/request_ixfr" may be used to replace it.  Also use
"database_file" under the "data_sources" module for bundy-xfrin
inbound transfers and use =bundy-loadzone -e= option to create an empty
zone prior to the first transfer.

The suite also provides DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers, a dynamic DNS
component, a DHCP performance testing program, and a C++ library
for DHCP.  ISC is continuing with the development of these components
in a new project, Kea.

For information about the Kea project, please visit http://kea.isc.org/.
If you have any questions or comments about working with the DHCP
code, you may post them to the Kea DHCP Mailing List
https://lists.isc.org/mailman/listinfo/kea-users.

For the full commit history, please see the ChangeLog and the git
Log.

Installation details are documented in the Guide
(http://bundy-dns.de/documentation.html).

The =./configure= options =--disable-dns= and =--disable-dhcp=
may be used to provide an optional DHCP- or DNS-only build and
installation.

Bundy was a sponsored development project (under the name BIND 10)
from April 2009 to April 2014, and would not be possible without the
generous support of the past sponsors: AFNIC, Afilias, CIRA, CNNIC,
CZ.NIC, DENIC eG, Google, IIS.SE, JPRS, Nominet, .nz Registry
Services, RIPE NCC, Registro.br, SIDN, and Technical Center of
Internet.  Support for the new DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 components is
provided by Comcast.
